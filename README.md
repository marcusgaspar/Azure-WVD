So in case of an image update, you have to re-create the host pool.<br>    <br>- Shared images (SIG). It’s        most likely that you want to keep using the existing host pool due to the fact of all the Remote Applications and Desktops – Applications groups and assignments. This is the part where the Azure shared image        gallery (SIG) comes in very handy due to the support for versioning,        read the benefits again here.

Premium storage accounts have up to max 100k IOPS   per share with 5 GBps per share at about 3 ms latency. The rule of the thumb   is that one user consumes between 5 and 15 IOPs (depending on the type of   workload).<br>   <br>To work   around this limit and stack up more Azure File shares to create more capacity   – there is an option to create filters based on Active Directory groups. You   must create an additional registry hive with the SID of that specific group   after Software\FSLogix\Profiles and in that hive, you can create all the   settings that must overrule the standard Profiles hive settings. This creates   the option to filter/overrule settings for users that are members of the   Active Directory Group – with effectively increasing on capacity – you can   stack as much as storage accounts as you need to accommodate more IOPs.<br>   <br>HKLM\SOFTWARE\FSLogix\Profiles\ObjectSpecific\S-1-5-21-306146113-3061682913-806882557-2166\<br>   <br>Create   in the registry hive a REG_SZ value   name “VHDLocations” and enter the new   (extra)Azure Files network file share path (e.g. \\fslogixwvddemo2.file.core.windows.net\fslogixprofiles).
