So in case of an image update, you have to re-create the host pool.<br>    <br>- Shared images (SIG). It’s most likely that you want to keep using the existing host pool due to the fact of all the Remote Applications and Desktops – Applications groups and assignments. This is the part where the Azure shared image        gallery (SIG) comes in very handy due to the support for versioning, read the benefits again here. It will automatically pick and select the latest image version.       	|    - Windows Virtual Desktop - #23 - Update Session Hosts from Latest Image    <br>From    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LxvwR9LGWQ>    <br><br> - Create an Azure Shared Image Gallery (SIG)    <br>From <https://christiaanbrinkhoff.com/2020/05/01/windows-virtual-desktop-technical-2020-spring-update-arm-based-model-deployment-walkthrough/#teamsoptimizations>    <br>        	|

Premium storage accounts have up to max 100k IOPS per share with 5 GBps per share at about 3 ms latency. The rule of the thumb is that one user consumes between 5 and 15 IOPs (depending on the type of   workload). <br>To work around this limit and stack up more Azure File shares to create more capacity – there is an option to create filters based on Active Directory groups. You must create an additional registry hive with the SID of that specific group after Software\FSLogix\Profiles and in that hive, you can create all the settings that must overrule the standard Profiles hive settings. This creates the option to filter/overrule settings for users that are members of the Active Directory Group – with effectively increasing on capacity – you can stack as much as storage accounts as you need to accommodate more IOPs.<br>   <br>HKLM\SOFTWARE\FSLogix\Profiles\ObjectSpecific\S-1-5-21-306146113-3061682913-806882557-2166\<br>   Create in the registry hive a REG_SZ value name “VHDLocations” and enter the new (extra)Azure Files network file share path (e.g. \\fslogixwvddemo2.file.core.windows.net\fslogixprofiles).   Repeat this for every group you create.<br> Read here more about the FSLogix ObjectSpecific settings.”<br>   https://www.christiaanbrinkhoff.com/2020/03/01/learn-here-how-to-configure-azure-files-with-active-directory-ad-authentication-for-fslogix-profile-container-and-msix-app-attach/<br>     	|    - Configure Profile Container and Office Container for per-user or per-group    <br>From    <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/fslogix/configure-per-user-per-group-ht>    <br><br> - Learn here how to configure Azure Files with Active Directory (AD) authentication for         Windows Virtual Desktop – FSLogix Profile Container and MSIX app attach    <br>From    <https://www.christiaanbrinkhoff.com/2020/03/01/learn-here-how-to-configure-azure-files-with-active-directory-ad-authentication-for-fslogix-profile-container-and-msix-app-attach/>    <br>        	|
